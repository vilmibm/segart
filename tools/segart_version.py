"""Segart version string + helper for embedding in produced metadata files.

Produced files (_toc.json, _articles.json.gz) carry a `software_versions`
block. Per user (2026-05-11), this is currently just `{segart_version}` —
we don't include git SHA, Python version, dep versions, etc. The block
is a dict (not a bare string) so we can extend it later without a schema
break.
